# Coding-Weeks-2022

Group project done during my first year at CentraleSupelec. The goal was to identify fake news tweets.

We first learned to use the twitter API and collect labeled tweets.

We then tried to use elements such as text sentiment and polarity to decide which tweets contained fake news. The results weren't very conclusive as we couldn't use ML models.
